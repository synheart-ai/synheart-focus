Synheart Focus is the cognitive concentration layer of Synheart — estimating moment-to-moment focus levels by fusing biosignals, behavioral interaction patterns, and circadian context. It powers Syni, Syni Life, SWIP, and any mind-aware application built on Synheart.

## 🚀 Features

- **🧠 Real-Time Focus Inference**: Continuous focus score estimation (0.0-1.0)
- **📊 Multimodal Fusion**: Combines HRV, stress, motion, and behavioral patterns
- **⚡ On-Device Processing**: Low-latency inference (< 20ms) with < 3MB model footprint
- **🎯 Focus Labels**: Discrete states (focused, distracted, scattered, fatigued)
- **📈 Cognitive Load Estimation**: Predicts mental workload and fatigue risk
- **🔒 Privacy-First**: No raw biometrics stored; only interpreted signals
- **🌐 Multi-Platform**: Python, Flutter/Dart, Android/Kotlin, iOS/Swift

**Platform-specific SDK repositories** (maintained separately):
- [synheart-focus-python](https://github.com/synheart-ai/synheart-focus-python) - Python SDK

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Python (Recommended for Testing)

```python
from synheart_focus import FocusEngine, FocusConfig

# Initialize engine
config = FocusConfig()
engine = FocusEngine.from_config(config)

# Subscribe to focus updates
def on_focus_update(focus_state):
    print(f"Focus Score: {focus_state.focus_score}")
    print(f"Label: {focus_state.focus_label}")
    print(f"Cognitive Load: {focus_state.cognitive_load}")

engine.subscribe(on_focus_update)

# Provide HSI inputs
hsi_data = {
    "hr": 72,
    "hrv_rmssd": 45,
    "stress_index": 0.3,
    "motion_intensity": 0.1
}

behavior_data = {
    "task_switch_rate": 0.2,
    "interaction_burstiness": 0.15,
    "idle_ratio": 0.1
}

# Infer focus state
focus_state = engine.infer(hsi_data, behavior_data)
```

### Flutter/Dart

```dart
import 'package:synheart_focus/synheart_focus.dart';

// Initialize
final focusEngine = FocusEngine.initialize(
  config: FocusConfig(),
);

// Subscribe to updates
focusEngine.onUpdate.listen((focusState) {
  print('Focus Score: ${focusState.focusScore}');
  print('Label: ${focusState.focusLabel}');
});

// Provide inputs and get focus state
final hsiData = HSIData(
  hr: 72,
  hrvRmssd: 45,
  stressIndex: 0.3,
  motionIntensity: 0.1,
);

final behaviorData = BehaviorData(
  taskSwitchRate: 0.2,
  interactionBurstiness: 0.15,
  idleRatio: 0.1,
);

final focusState = await focusEngine.infer(hsiData, behaviorData);
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

Synheart Focus is a **multimodal fusion model** that combines:

### Inputs

1. **HSI (Biosignal) Inputs**:
   - Heart rate (HR)
   - Heart rate variability (HRV - RMSSD, stability, variability)
   - Stress index
   - Motion intensity / micro-jitter
   - Respiration proxies (if available)
   - HSI embedding vector
   - Short rolling history (2-5 minutes)
   - Circadian context

2. **Behavioral Inputs** (from Synheart Behavior SDK):
   - Task switch rate
   - Interaction burstiness
   - Idle ratio
   - Notification interruptions
   - Steady vs scattered interaction rhythm

3. **Context Inputs**:
   - Sleep deficit
   - Recovery score
   - Circadian phase
   - Time since last break
   - Time-of-day patterns

### Outputs

For every time window (30-60 seconds, updated every 1-2 minutes):

| Output | Description | Range |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| `focus_score` | Continuous focus estimate | 0.0 → 1.0 |
| `focus_label` | Discrete state | focused, distracted, scattered, fatigued |
| `focus_trend` | Short-term trend | increasing, decreasing, stable |
| `cognitive_load` | Workload estimate | low, normal, high |
| `deep_focus_block` | Sustained focus flag | true/false |
| `fatigue_risk` | Focus decline likelihood | 0.0 → 1.0 |
